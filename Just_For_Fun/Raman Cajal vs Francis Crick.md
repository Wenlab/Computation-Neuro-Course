# Cajal vs Crick 

Raman Cajal once wrote

> We realized that all of the various conformations of the neuron and its various components are simply morphological adaptations governed by laws of conservation for time, space, and material.

However, Francis Crick wrote

> Arguments about “efficiency” are thus almost always to be mistrusted in biology since we don’t know the exact problems faced by myriads of organisms in evolution. And without knowing that, how can we decide what form of efficiency paid off?

Who do you agree with?

# My Personal Opinion

## Paul Dirac's quote

Paul Dirac once said

> My equation is so beautiful that it can not be wrong.

However, we all know that many beautiful models are wrong.



## 2 criterion

You can raise your model based on anything: efficiency, beauty, simplicity, imagination, or anything else you like. But you must **go back to experiments**, instead of keeping daydreaming and arguing.



There are 2 criterion to check if your model is a good/useful model.

* Explain the existing experiment phenomena well.
* Predict new experiment phenomena. **The more unexpected, the better.**



So, think about the models in the history of biology, which are good models and which are bad?

## bad

* Comma-free code by Francis Crick.
* Theory of two currents in vision.



## Think about Physics

In physics, there are more cases. I list a little, leaving you to supplement them. You may get bonus points for it.

## Summary

**All in all, efficiency, beauty, simplicity, imagination are all good ways to build a theoretical model, but, your model should not only explain current experiment results, but also predict new experiment phenomena.**
